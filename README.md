# Shop Application (Multi-Module Project)

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)

> ðŸš§ This project is still under development. Features may change frequently.

## Overview

This project is a **multi-module backend application** built with **Java** and **Spring Boot**.
It simulates the backend of an e-commerce platform with modular separation of concerns.
Each module handles a specific domain such as authentication, product management, ordering, payment, review and inventory.

The goal is to practice **modular monolith architecture**, **secure authentication/authorization**, and **event-driven communication** within a single project.

## Features

* **Authentication & Authorization**

    * JWT-based authentication with Spring Security
    * Refresh token caching using Redis
    * HttpOnly cookies for refresh token storage
    * Role-based authorization for modules

* **CRUD Operations**

    * Hard-delete and soft-delete implemented across entities
    * Modular separation for product, order, payment, and inventory management

* **Product Module**

    * Manage products and product variants
    * Support for placing product orders

* **Order Module**

    * Order lifecycle management with status flow:
      `pending_verification â†’ confirmed â†’ paid`
    * Validation of product details before confirming orders

* **Payment Module**

    * Cash on Delivery (COD) payment support
    * Updates order status after successful payment

* **Review Module**

  * Allows users to leave reviews on product variants
  * Only users who have **ordered and paid** for a product variant can submit a review for it
  
* **Event-Driven Workflow (with RabbitMQ)**

    * Order module verifies product details via events with Product module
    * Order module communicates with Payment module to process total price
    * Payment module confirms successful payment back to Order module
